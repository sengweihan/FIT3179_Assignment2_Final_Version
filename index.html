        From that map, we can see that
        <span style="font-size: larger; color: #ff4d00"><b>Russia</b></span>
        and
        <span style="font-size: larger; color: #ff0000"><b>Lithuania</b></span>
        are having the highest suicide cases per 100,000 population as compared
        to other countries due to their obvious darker shade of color.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the factors that caused
        <span style="font-size: larger; color: #ff4d00"><b>Russia</b></span>
        to have such a high suicide rate is its enormous population of citizens.
      </p>

      <p>There are certain countries colored grey due to limited data.</p>

            The line chart on the left shows the total
            <span style="color: red; font-size: larger">suicide cases</span> for
            different ages over the years.
          </p>

          <p>
            From there, we can see that overall, people with age between
            <span style="color: #1261a0; font-size: larger"
              ><b>35-54 years</b></span
            >
            have the highest number of suicide cases throughout the year 1985 to
            2015. I assumed that the reason for this might be due to them facing
            huge financial difficulties which makes them give up on their life
            to avoid paying the debt.
          </p>

          <p>
            On the other hand, people with age between &nbsp;
            <span style="color: #7a51d0; font-size: larger"
              ><b>5-14 years</b></span

            have the lowest number of suicide cases throughout the year 1985 to
            2015 as compared to other ages. This does make sense because people
            with age between
            <span style="color: #7a51d0; font-size: larger"
              ><b>5-14 years</b></span
            >
            does not suffer from any mental health issues as well as financial
            issues.

          <p>
            From the chart, we can see that overall, the number of cases for
            <span style="color: #255eba; font-size: larger"><b>males</b></span>
            is more than for

              ><b>females</b></span
            >
            over the years.
          </p>

          <p>
            Based on research, although
            <span style="color: #aa336a; font-size: larger"
              ><b>females</b></span
            >
            attempt suicide at a higher rate as compared to
            <span style="color: #255eba; font-size: larger"><b>males</b></span
            >, they are more likely to use methods that are less lethal such as
            drug overdose and if they are noticed in the early stage by others,
            then they will have a chance to survive.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, this is not the case for
            <span style="color: #255eba; font-size: larger"><b>males</b></span>
            as they tend to die by suicide via high-mortality actions such as
            hanging, carbon monoxide poisoning, and firearms.

            <p>I am assuming that the country  <span style="color: white; font-size: larger"
              ><b>Japan</b></span
            > is one of the top
              contributors that lead to that outcome. As we all knew, that country is famous for
